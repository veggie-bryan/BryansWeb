      <p id="intro" class="rounded-block">
        Hi, my name is Bryan! I'm a mechanical engineering graduate student at USC specializing in thermofluids. 
        This is a small showcase for my other projects.
      </p>

        <h2>My Experience:</h2>
          <h3>The Aerospace Corporation, Thermal Engineering Intern</h3>
            <p>
              TBD (◑‿◐)
            </p>
          <h3>Varda Space Industries, Thermal Engineering Intern</h3>
              <p>
                > Ran flight studies to determine the thermal sensitivty of our spacecraft to attitude deltas and assured all components (structural/propulsion/avionics/etc.) were not approaching or surpassing operational limits. <br><br>
                > Redesigned reentry vehicle thermal model components to cut down run times by reducing node/element count while retaining accurate temperature gradients/heat flows and helped correlate "bang-bang" heater transient behavior. <br><br>
                > Reworked post-processing script's data structure and looping configuration to improve run times (400s --> 30s) and added imporved visual display + storage features.
              </p>
          <h3>Rocket Lab, Thermal Engineering Intern</h3>
              <p>
                > Led honeycomb panel dev test to capture anisotropic conductivity properties and effects of adhesive failure on TC install: performed hand calcs, wrote procedure, ran sim cases, set up harness/DAQ/coupon, correlated, and post processed results. <br><br>
                > Helped with NASA EscaPADE thermal control system assembly and test: multi-layer insulation, thermocouples, heaters. <br><br>
                > Assisted with correlations by refining initial finite element model of IR camera to better represent TVAC test temperatures and collected thermal-optical data (emissivity/absorptivity) of tape samples using emissometer.
              </p>
          <h3>Millennium Space Systems, Engineering Intern</h3>
              <p>
                > Created burn-in test procedure for satellite PCBA to assure it could withstand extreme temperatures in space. <br><br>
                > Performed root cause investigations and implemented corrective actions on manufacturing and supply chain discrepancies. <br><br>
                > Led the transition of the As-Run review process from the document control to the quality team to minimize potential errors in numerical values: proper instrument calibration and temperature, humidity, resistance, and voltage ranges.
              </p>
          <h3>College of Engineering, Tutor</h3>
              <p>
                > Helped students understand concepts in fluids, thermo, power plant design, MATLAB, and other engineering courses. <br><br>
              </p>
